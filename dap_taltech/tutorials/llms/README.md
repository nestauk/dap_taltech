## ðŸŽ“ Get Started

As we make extensive use of OpenAI LLMs and chat models, you will need to add the OpenAI API key as an environment variable. We will provide you with a key at the beginning of the hack week. 

You can do this by executing the following in your terminal:

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-.."
```
Alternatively, you can create a `.env` file in the root of this repository and add the following line to it:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-.."
```

Then, navigate to the tutorial and follow the instructions and code blocks.
