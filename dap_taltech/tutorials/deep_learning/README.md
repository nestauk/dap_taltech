# ðŸ“º Deep learning tutorial

This directory contains tutorials related to deep learning.

The **goals** of the `deep-learning.ipynb` tutorial are to:

1. Learn about the building blocks of PyTorch, from layer creation to regularisation and model training.
2. Train feed-forward neural networks on traditional and computer vision tasks.
3. Explore how more advanced network structures can be leveraged to perform time series analysis, and how convolutional layers impact the performance of neural networks on computer vision tasks.
4. Load pre-trained language models from huggingface and use transfer learning to showcase NLP applications.

## ðŸŽ“ Get Started

To install the deep learning specific requirements, run the following command:

```pip install -r dl_requirements.txt```

Then, navigate to `deep-learning.ipynb` and follow the instructions and code blocks.
