## ‚è≤Ô∏è Time series forecasting 

This directory contains related to traditional time series techniques and machine learning using time series data. 

1. `ts_methods.ipynb` - This notebook focuses primarily on traditional time series methods. You will learn about checking for stationarity, decomposing time series, autocorrelation plots and Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous variables (SARIMAX). There are **üõ∏ TASK** to complete along the way.

2. `ml_in_ts.ipynb` - This notebook primarily focuses on traditional machine learning methods using time series data. You will learn about data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training and hyperparameter tuning. There are **üõ∏ TASK** to complete along the way.

## üéì Get Started

To successfully run the notebooks, you will need to have specific packages and models installed. To install the time series specific requirements, run the following command:

```pip install -r ts_requirements.txt```

Navigate to the first notebook (`ts_methods`) and follow the instructions and code blocks. Once that is completed, feel free to move onto `ml_in_ts.ipynb`. Enjoy your journey through the engaging world of time series and traditional ML!
